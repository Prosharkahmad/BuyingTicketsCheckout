# BuyingTicketsCheckout

This is the App i use React and Redux Toolkit. 

1st Phase i make a dummy data of shows. Which is listed in the component outside of the function. 
2nd Phase i make the functionality and added objects in usestate Hook array. No duplication is added. Duplication is prevented by new Set.
3rd Phase i setup the redux toolkit Through the final data into redux toolkit. 
4rth Phase i setup the Checkout component Like i named BillingInformation

For Designing i used the React Bootstrap

Note: When you refresh the page the data will be lost because i didn't use the redux persist. 

Thanks
